11945	5	3	3	In protein synthesis, after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it carries the instructions to the cytooplasm.  It then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied.  Transfer RNA brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome. It attaches at the first bonding site which  matches the complementary codons. THe tRNA the moves on the the next bonding site where it releases the amino acid which attaches to the amino acid on the tRNA behind it.  Once the mRNA reaches a stop codon, the amino acids detach and form a polypeptide bond.
11984	5	3	2	4 steps involved in protein synthesis is mRNA is moving into the cytoplams, then it binds with the rRNA in ribosome, then tRNA binds its anticodon to the codon of the mRNA, then translation occurs and polypeptide chains of amino acids are formed.
11992	5	3	3	The mRNA enters the ribosome. It then begins translation when the anticodons from the tRNA match up with the codons on the mRNA. The starting codon is always Met. As the tRNA attaches to the mRNA, the amino acids above them form peptide bonds. Finally, the last step is the stop codon on the mRNA. This signals the end of protein synthesis.
12007	5	3	3	mRNA leaves the nucleasmRNA codes for tRNAamino acids on tRNA bond to form a chain of amino acidsthe chain of amino acids folds into a protein.mRNA leaves the nucleas after being copied from DNA.  This mRNA is single stranded and contains codons for specific types of proteins.mRNA then travels to a ribosome.  At the ribosome, the mRNA is run through, and tRNA with anticodons on one end attach to the mRNA.Each tRNA particle has an amino acid attached on the opposite end of the anticodon.  When two tRNA particles connect to the mRNA at the same time, a peptide bond forms between the two amino acids and the first piece of tRNA can disconnect.  As this process continues, the amino acids begin to form a chain.Once the strand of mRNA contains a stop codon and tRNA reaches it, the final amino acid will bond to the chain.  Once this animo acid disconnects with the tRNA, the strand folds up into a specific protein.
12031	5	3	3	First, the mRNA goes to a ribosome.  It connects with the ribosome and then tRNA comes and connects with the ribosome.  The tRNA reads the mRNA and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mRNA.  This forms an amino acid.  This continues to happen until you have a long chain of amino acids and the mRNA tells the tRNA to stop decoding.
12033	5	3	3	During protein synethesis, the DNA is being replicated and forming mRNA durning transcription. Then after it leaves the nucleus, it enters the cytoplasm. Translation takes place in the cytoplasm. A polypeptide chain forms during tanslation which turns into proteins. The tRNA carries 3 anticodons to the 3 condons on the mRNA. When that is all done it makes a chain of amino acids.
12051	5	3	3	(1) When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels through the cell to a ribosome. (2)The mRNA is then read by the ribosome. (3)The ribosome matches the mRNA sequence with a complementary tRNA sequence, which then codes for a specific protein. (4)The protein is then added to a chain which codes for specific genes.
12123	5	3	3	1-the mRNA travels to a ribosome 2-The codons on the mRNA signal for an amino acid3-Translation-tRNA match up an amino acid to each codon on the mRNA starting with the start codon4-termination-the amino acids are matched up with the codons on the mRNA until the stop codon is reached, which signals the end of translation
12144	5	3	3	1. A ribosome attaches to the mRNA (rRNA). Translation Occurs;2. Codons are coded for a specific amino acid.3. Anticodons that are in the tRNA are paired with the codons in the mRNA. 4. Peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured. New proteins are made.
12329	5	3	3	The mRNA enters the ribosome.Start codon enters P site, second codon at A site.tRNA adds a amino acid to the codon at the P site and A site.The P site codon breaks apart and the codon at the A site takes its place and the process continues until you hit a stop codon, the chain of amino acids creates a protein.
12387	5	3	3	mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell to begin protein synthesis. From the nucleus the first step includes the mRNA attatching to the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the form of ribosomes. The second step is for the mRNA to be copied to tRNA. tRNA is a complimentary copy to mRNA. The third step,the tRNA is copied into a complimentary rRNA.The codons are read and ready for synthesis. The fourth step includes the assembly of the protein, beginning with a start amino acid and ending with a stop amino acid.
12394	5	3	3	1. mRNA floats to a ribosome (rRNA) in the cytoplasm and reads three bases (codon)2. tRNA matches up with proper amino acids and then pulls its amino acids to the ribosome and lines up its anitcodons with the codons3. RNA moves forward and realeases three bases at a time and the tRNA then realeases its amino acids and drifts away.4. The amino acids bond (peptide bond) and form a chain of amino acids which is now a protein. the protein then goes and does its job in the body.
12467	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, after going through the process of trancription where the RNA polymerase unzip the strand into two identical halves, the mRNA goes to the ribosome. Translation occurs when tRNA makes a copy of the DNA segment and complementary base pairs are linked to the half of the mRNA strand. The complementary base pairs start to link onto the mRNA strand only when the start codon is identify and complemented. Then the tRNA brings amino acids and builds the amino acids onto the molecule making a protein chain. Finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mRNA strand.
12500	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes out into the cytoplasm on a ribosome. The ribosome attaches and reads until it sees the codon AUG. Once it sees this codon, it starts pairing the bases with complementary anticodons on the tRNA. The tRNA brings amino acids that link together to form a protein. This process terminates at a stop codon.
12561	5	3	3	When translation begins, the mRNA goes with a ribosome and attaches itself to a start codon. It then goes with a ribosome to start adding the anticodons to the codons added on to the genetic code; the anticodons are added by the tRNA. The tRNA attaches to the P site first then moves to the A site when the it attaches an amino acid to the amino acid chain, then this process continues until a stop codon is reached. The result is the newly created protein.
12515	5	3		1-the mRNA travels to a ribosome 2-The codons on the mRNA signal for an amino acid3-Translation-tRNA match up an amino acid to each codon on the mRNA starting with the start codon4-termination-the amino acids are matched up with the codons on the mRNA until the stop codon is reached, which signals the end of translation
12516	5	3		Next, mRNA attaches to a ribosome where the code on it will be translated to the order of amino acids needed to make a protein.  rRNA combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.  tRNA finds amino acids that match with the code it carries and takes carries them to the ribosome where it matches its amino acids to the code on teh mRNA.  All of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein.
11941	5	2	2	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then, the mRNA enters a ribosome. The ribosome then reads the mRNA sequence and sends for tRNA, which brings a codon pairing with the one shown in the mRNA as well as an amino acid. This repeats, with the amino acids joining together, eventually making a protein.
11953	5	2	2	The mRNA goes to the ribosome where the tRNA translates the mRNA's codons into peptide chains that then make a polypeptide chain that goes with others to make a protien.
12018	5	2	1	1. mRNA heads to the Ribosome2. mRNA gets decoded3. tRNA grabs an amino acid and brings it back to the decoded mRNA4. rRNA  is taken back to the nucleus
12032	5	2	2	1.the mRNA will have to be translated after it leaves the nucleus.2. When the strand is translated tRNA will add anticodons to it.3. tRNA will carry amino acids with it to bind to the strand. 4. the amino acids will bind creating a protein.
12045	5	2	2	After mRNA leaves the nucleus (replication has occured), it has four major steps involving its protein synthesis. The mRNA will travel into the cytoplasm to be attatched to a tRNA with complimentary bases. Transcription occurs here. The mRNA is being transcribed. Then the tRNA undergoes translation with amino acids. Coded codons are used in this step to create the correct amino acid chain. This step involves other ribosomes to complete the chain. When the chain of amino acids is complete, elongation occurs where there is a stop codon and the sequencing will stop. replicationtranscriptiontranslationelongation
12058	5	2	2	After copying the DNA sequence, mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell. The mRNA then heads to a rRNA, where synthesis can begin. The mRNA feeds the code through the rRNA. Based on what three bases you have in each segment, a tRNA will bring that corresponding amino acid. The amino acids form an amino acid chain, which is also called a protein. After the mRNA has gone all the way through, the last amino acid added is the stop amino acid. After this process, all three RNAs have created a protein.
12115	5	2	2	tRNA then attaches to the mRNA, matching its bases to those of the mRNA.  The segments formed by the mRNA are called codons.  These codons code for specific amino acids.  The amino acids form a chain on the tRNA, forming a protein.
12152	5	2	2	codons are made on the rna strand.the codons are tranferred to amino acids.the amino acids make proteins.the stop codon is used to stop the production of more amino acids.
12258	5	2	2	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm.  There, it attaches to a ribosome.  Attatched to the ribosome, rRNA comes and brings different codons for amino acids from the mRNA strand to the tRNA strand.  The ribosome moves down the tRNA strand.  The codons attach to the anticodons of the tRNA strand.  As this occurs, ribosomes are forming a strand that codes for the protein.  When the rRNA brings a stop codon, the process ends and the strand containing the protein brakes off to form the actual amino acid for the cell.
12286	5	2	2	The four major steps are that the mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying information to make protein.  The mRNA lands on the rRNA and waits for the tRNA to bring amino acids.  The tRNA brings the amino acids which the mRNA lines up to make a complete protein.
12290	5	2	3	1) mRNA leaves nucleus through a nuclear pore2) tRNA comes carrying the complementary codon and amino         acid3) As the tRNA creates amino acids, rRNA moves along the            strand after each amino acid is complete. After a new amino        acid is created, it binds to the previous one, forming a peptide      bond4) When the tRNA encounters a stop codon, the amino acid            chain is complete
12328	5	2	2	1. mRNA meets with rRNA.2. tRNA brings codes for amino acids and brings them to the site of synthesis.3. rRNA reads mRNA and codes for the amino acids needed. 4. An amino acid chain forms
12349	5	2	2	The mRNA leaves the nucleus with the instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein. It then transfers the instructions to the tRNA to start the sequence. With the information it has it makes the sequence until it gets the codone to stop.
12399	5	2	2	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it attaches to a ribosome. The mRNA contains a codon that will bind with a specific anticodon. Transfer RNA carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mRNA. The codon and anticodon bind, and form an amino acid. More and more tRNA molecules bring anticodons to the mRNA codons, which produce a growing polypeptide chain. This chain will be a protein.
12436	5	2	2	The ribosome comes to the mRNA strand.  Then two rRNA molecules start to decode the strand.  As it decodes a protien is produced on the outside of the ribosome.  When it reaches the stop codon the protien is finished and the ribosome leaves the mRNA strand.
12439	5	2	3	it then goes to the ribosomes. codons then match the anticodons brought by the tRNA every anticodon brings with it an amino asid that corresponds with the secuance of the nitrogonous bases.the amino acid is made and once the stop codon is pus on,the protein goes.
12565	5	2	2	1. The mRNA goes into the cytoplasm and finds a ribosmome .2. The mRNA has the code and the tRNA gets this code, and finds the amino acid that matches this code. 3. The rRNA acts as a holding device while this is going on. 4. The tRNA brings back the amino acid to the ribosome where the protein is made because amino acids are the monomer of proteins.
12656	5	2	2	1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus.2. The mRNA finds the ribosome.3. The amino acids that mach the genitic sequences on the mRNA come down and attach themselves to eachother.4.The amino acids form a protein after all of them have been attached.
12679	5	2	2	The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a small hole, only sizable for it. It then goes to the ribosome. Once its in, the tRNA begings to match it up with the opposite letters in pairs of three. The strand leaves the ribosome in pairs of three, the amino acid sequence to make the protiens we need.
12680	5	2	2	1.  The DNA unzips and is copied to create mRNA which can then leave the nucleus because it is single stranded.2. After leaving the Nucleus, the mRNA travels to the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome.3. The Ribosome then attaches tRNA to the corresponding nucleotide sequences. The tRNA has amino acids attached to the end of it.4. After a second tRNA is attached, the aminoacids form a phosphate bond with eachother and the first tRNA is ejected to recieve another Amino acids. This step repeats until the protein is complete, the stop codon is reached, and a the last amino acid breaks from the last tRNA
12517	5	2		The mRNA leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome. Then, tRNA that fits comes and attaches to the mRNA. The tRNA then builds up into Amino Acids that link together to become a protein.
12522	5	2		1.the mRNA will have to be translated after it leaves the nucleus.2. When the strand is translated tRNA will add anticodons to it.3. tRNA will carry amino acids with it to bind to the strand. 4. the amino acids will bind creating a protein.
12523	5	2		The ribosome comes to the mRNA strand.  Then two rRNA molecules start to decode the strand.  As it decodes a protien is produced on the outside of the ribosome.  When it reaches the stop codon the protien is finished and the ribosome leaves the mRNA strand.
11670	5	1	1	first it travels in a long line to ribosomessecond the mrna is ripped in halfthird a new strand is made to connect to the mrnalast it lives happily ever after
11671	5	1	1	it gose to a ribosome, and a tRNA links up with the ribosom/mRNA to make a specific protien, the protien gets attached to another over and over again to from a protien chain.
11673	5	1	1	The mRNA first goes to the ER.Then the ER makes the protein.Next the tRNA begins to carry the proteins.Finally the tRNA comes back to the cell.
11675	5	1	1	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes into the cytoplasm with the amino aid sequence of a protein which was translated from the DNA. Then the tRNA attatches to the mRNA and takes the amino acid sequence and copies it. The tRNA then goes to the ribosome, the organelle where protein synthesis takes place. The tRNA, which contains the amino acid sequence for assembling the proteins, gives its information for protein synthesis to the ribosome. The ribosome then assembles the proteins with the sequence given to it by tRNA.
11687	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and matches up with tRNA. Then it splits and creates a new, complimentary strand of RNA.
11691	5	1	1	After the mRNA leaves the nucles, it sets out to find the ribosome to make rRNA and give the needed amino acid code that is needed to make proteins. After completing this, it transforms into tRNA to transfer the code. After getting the needed amino acids, it then transforms back into mRNA and heads back to the nucleus.
11693	5	1	1	When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to rRNA, and then it changes to tRNA, which carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acids.
11699	5	1	1	1. The mRNA is split in half.2. One half of the mRNA runs through a ribosome.3. While the half of the mRNA is being ran through the ribosome, a protien is being made according to the instructions. 4. The protien travels to wherever it is 'programmed' to go, and to do whatever it is 'programmed' to do.
11702	5	1	1	after the mRNA leaves the nucleus it binds with the rRNA. after they bind together they begin transciption to make more copies for more protiens. After transcription occurs translation begins to decode the RNA that has been made . After this has been done the RNA then begins to made amino acid that will form protiens.
11703	5	1	1	In protein synthesis, the mRNA must first leave the nucleus. It then goes to the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome. From there, it attaches to its complimentary codon. And finally becomes a protein strand.
11722	5	1	1	the mRNA leaves the nucleas and goes to tRNA which transfers the codons and anticodons then which gets translated into a sequence which produces amino acids and then in the sequence makes proteins.
11724	5	1	2	1.the RNA goes into a ribosome2. transfer RNA brings amino acids to mach the sequence of the mRNA.3. as more tRNA comes  with more amino acids the amino acids start to stack up4.the compleated protins breaks away.
11735	5	1	1	After leaving the nucleus, mRNA goes to the ribosomes and turns into tRNA. Once it becomes tRNA, it makes codons or becomes anticodons. Once it becomes codons, it makes amino acids.
11739	5	1	2	First mRNA leaves the nucleus with a strand of DNA which contains the instructions to making an amino acid. It takes the DNA strand to the tRNA in the ribosomes. There the tRNA uses the codons to make the sequence of amino acids. The amino acids are then transferred by the tRNA to the rRNA where they become a protein.
11743	5	1	1	The first step is where the mRNA goes to the ribosones  soo they DNA can be replicated. The second step is wjere the tRNA gets added with the DNA. The third step is  when the tRNA foes back to the nucleus to get added to the DNA. i cant remember the last.
11754	5	1	1	start codon, code for RNA, protein is made, stop codon
11755	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome. Where tRNA then translates the mRNA into proteins.
11766	5	1	1	Step 1 the mrna goes out and grabs the sequence that is needed. Step2 the mrna sequnce choosen then codes for tranlation. The trna then takes the base pair codes and goes out and grabs the aminoacids.Step3 the amino acid sequence would then be added to the original. Step4 a new strand with a new sequence would be formed.
11768	5	1	1	The mRNA goes to a ribosme.Then it gets fitted with an amino acid. Then it becomes tRNA. Then it can be used as a protien.
11773	5	1	1	1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus to take the information of the amino acid to the protein2. The tRNA go out to get amino acids. 3. The tRNA bring the amino acids back to the nucleus.4. They attach them to the strand of DNA.
11776	5	1	1	all T's are tuned int U's. the mRNA is translated into codons. codons ar turned into ameno acids. ameno acids are turned into a proteins
11783	5	1	1	Protein synthesis occurs by mRNA transporting it to the endoplasmic reticulum. Then the protein is copied and then split several times again. Then the proteins copies are later returned to the nucleus and used from then on out.
11789	5	1	1	TRANSCRIPTION: THE PROCESS OF COPYING THE DNA AND MAKING THE mRNA.THE mRNA IS THEN DELIVERED TO THE RIBOSOMETRANSLATION: THE mRNA IS READ BY tRNATHEN THE CELL PRODUCES PROTIEN BY BUILDING IT
11794	5	1	1	The first thing it does is that is travels throught the cells cytoplasm to to ribosomes. Then the ribosomes help turn it into protein. The protein is taken my tRNA back to the nucleus and then the prosess starts all over again.
11801	5	1	1	the mRNA is decoded and ine infermation is copied and used to creat the protiens
11806	5	1	1	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels through the cell.  It moves to a ribosome.  The ribosome makes tRNA.  Then, protien is synthesized.
11810	5	1	1	After mRNA leaves the nucleus it goes through the endoplasmic reticulum, which filters the bad protiens out, then it is released into the cytoplasma of the cell, then it leaves the cell and transports diferent material to a different cell.
11823	5	1	1	transcription, ribosome calls for amino acids, translation. proteins are made by the amino acids binding together.
11827	5	1	1	During protein synthesis, mRNA leaves the nucleus.  The tRNA takes the anti-codon and matches it with the corresponding codon on the mRNA molecule.  It attaches on the ribosome.    This then makes the amino acid polypeptide chain.  Once those steps are complete, you have the protein that the mRNA was coded for.
11829	5	1	1	The DNA is copied by the mRNA. Then is translated by the tRNA. then for every 3 strands of codons are translated an amino acid chain is formed. Then when the code for stop happens a protein is formed.
11837	5	1	1	After leaving the nucleus there are a few steps in protein synthesis.  mRNA enters the ribosome and prepares for transcription.  In transcription the enzyme, RNA polymerase binds to DNA and splits the two strands apart.  It then uses one strand as a template for nucleotides to form a strand of RNA.  Then it has to go into translation.  mRNA is used as instructions for decoding.  The ribosome is what makes the protein.
11838	5	1	1	1.) Transcription- where tRNA codes for a certain amino acid. 2.) The amino acid is created according to what the tRNA coded for.3.) The sequence is held together by peptide bonds.4.) The amino acid sequence is taken back by the mRNA
11839	5	1	2	First the mRNA leaves the nucleus after it got transcribed from half of a strand of DNA. The small and large ribosomes then attach to the RNA to translate it. The codons get translated to an amino acid, and the small and large ribosomes pull the needed amino acid over and go to the next codon. They do this until they have a long strand of amino acids to make a protein.
11841	5	1	0	The mRNA makes a  copy of the DNA strand. the mRNA gives it the tRNA that sends. then the rRNAmakes a protien chain. the protien chain then moves and makes a new cell.
11848	5	1	1	mRNA attaches to proteinProtein reaches the start codonProtein reaches the stop codonSequence ends
11856	5	1	1	tRNA breaks loose and grabs onto amino acids. mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes over to the ribosome. tRNA goes to the ribosome with the Amino acids. mRNA bonds everything together.
11861	5	1	1	The mRNA goes to the ribosomes for the instructions on making protein.  It then goes to the mitochondria to get energy. They it goes back to the nucleus to produce the protein.
11875	5	1	1	mRNA leaves the nucleus, then it arrives a a ribosome where it is turned in to tRNA. Then ammino acid prduction begins and segments of the tRNA are copied to produce them.
11879	5	1	1	the mRNA leaves the nucleus with the information to build the protein. the mRNA takes the information to the ribosome, which then reads the information in sequences of three, called codons.  Then the Ribosome will search for the correct codon, which is carried by the tRNA. this creates a sequence of amino acids, and when there are the correct amount of amino acids, it is created into a protein.
11894	5	1	1	1. the mRNA goes with the protien sythesis to the rough ER.2. the tRNA then proceeds with the information for protein production.3.
11910	5	1	1	Go to the goli apparatus, then it takes the messages to the ribosomes to be taken where the information needs to be place, and the part where it is placed will know what to do next.
11925	5	1	2	The first step, as already stated, is the mRNA leaving the nucleus to be formed into a protein.  The mRNA then encounters rRNA (the ribosome), which begins reading off the codons on the mRNA to begin forming a protein.  Transfer RNA then comes with anticodons to form amino acids that form together to create the protein.
11926	5	1	1	It travels throught the ER then the Golgi Apperatus.
11929	5	1	1	It attatches to the Endoplasmic Reticulum.Then what is not needed gets sent to the lysosomes.
11939	5	1	2	The mRNA goes to the ribosome were the P site and A site attach. The tRNA brings the anticodon and the amino acid. The anticodon matches with the correct codon. The amino acids that the tRNAs have brought over all connect in the correct formation.
11966	5	1	1	1 The mRNA takes the energy to the ribosomes.2 It then gives the energy to the tRNA.3 The tRNA transfers this energy into the ribosomes.4 The ribosomes turn the energy into protein.
11967	5	1	1	First the mRNA leaves the nucleus and locates in the cytoplasm at the ribosomes. Once it was relocated to the ribosomes it is transfered into rRNA and then read by the tRNA. Once the tRNA reads the information amino acids are produced and they are the building blocks of proteins.
11970	5	1	1	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus.2. Then the mRNA travels to the ER and rough ER.3. Both of the ER's then make the proteins.4. Finally the proteins are transported to the ribosomes where they are held until needed.
11971	5	1	2	Four major step are involved whenever the mRNA leaves the nucleus. The first major step is that the mRNA becomes attached to a ribosome. The next step is that the mRNA joins with the tRNA. The third step is that for every three codons the tRNA creat anit-codons. The last step is the making of the amino acids by the tRNA transfering the anti-codons into amino acids, which is needed fpr tje reproduction of DNA.
11972	5	1	1	1. mRNA reaches the ribosome.2. The mRNA is read and is copied.3. The mRNA sequence is copied to tRNA.4. The tRNA is then copied and the copies are used to make more proteins.
11974	5	1	1	The mRNA moves from the nucleus to the RNA. Then the rRNA begins to read the mRNA. The tRNA goes to get an amino acid and brings it back to the rRNA. Once it has the amino acid, the protein begins to be replicated.
11976	5	1	1	The mRNA will reach a ribosome. The tRNA will find the amino acid that the mRNA needs. The amino acids will stick together. A protein will be made out of the amino acid strand.
11978	5	1	1	1. The mRNA arives at the ribazones.2. The ribazones decode the mRNA.3. The ribazones use the decoded mRNA to mek proteins.4. The proteins are used for energy in the cell.
11980	5	1	1	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through a process called transcription. The mRNA travels to a ribosome, and more proteins are made. As this is happening, the mRNA also continues to make more polypeptides on the strand. After this a complementary strand is formed, and another strand of DNA is made.
11989	5	1	1	Translation- mRNA is translated into codonsTranscription- Codons code for amino acidsAmino acids are hooked together to create a chainThe chain creates a protein
11991	5	1	1	The four major steps involved in protein sylnthesis is the mRNA leaves the nucleus then it goes and gets the message decoded. After that then the body sends out the proper proteins. Lastly the proper proteins are sent and the process is started all over again.
12006	5	1	1	mRNA exits the nucleus, then it sends message to the ribosome. It does this by entering the ribosome, once here a amino acid is assembled. The acid is attached by a codon that was put forth due to the mRNA's message. After this the new amino acids is put forth and joined with others, this forms the protein.
12016	5	1	1	1. mRNA seperates from DNA and leaves the nucleus2. The mRNA gives information for making protein3. Codon signals start to make amino acids for proteins4. Sequence hits a stop codon and the protein is released into the cell
12020	5	1	1	The mRNA goes to the ribosomes to deliver the genetic code from the nucleus.  The ribsomes connect the nucleic acids and send it to the Golgi Apparatus.  Then the Gogli aparatus gets rid of the bad proteins.  Then gets the good proteins ready to be used in the cell.
12021	5	1	1	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Then, it is bonded to a ribosome and it starts to decode the mRNA. Next, the different nucleic acids arrive and match up with the mRNA codons. Last, the amino acid is formed, and the process continues at the Endoplasmic Reticulum where, eventually, all those amino acids make up a protein.
12023	5	1	1	The mRNA must first go to the ribosome. then the ribosome makes what ever it was told to make. After that tRNA come and transport the protien to its destenation.
12047	5	1	1	Step 1, the mRNA leaves the nucleus. Step 2, the protein is sent to the ribosomes. Step 3 , the protein is the synthesized, and step 4, the mRNA returns the synthesized protein to the nucleus.
12048	5	1	1	mRNA copies it's self with DNA to make a codon strand mRNA sends information to the tRNA the tRNA then translates the codons the rRNA produces proteins
12061	5	1	1	Transcrpition, translation, tRNA carrying amino acids and anticodons enter and make a peptide chain, peptide chain is formed when peptide bonds are added between the amino acids.
12064	5	1	1	The mRNA is translated into tRNA. Then, the ribosomes helps with protein synthesis by transcribing the tRNA into amino acids which then are put together to make proteins which are then formed into polypeptides.
12085	5	1	1	When mRNA leavs the nucleus the mRNA must find rhibosomes to tell them how to make protein. When the mRNA finds the rhibosomes the RNA helps them make the protein. One of the major steps is to find out what the mRNA was told to do by the DNA. When the rhibosomes find out what the mRNA has told them they go to work.
12095	5	1	1	After leaving the nucleus, the mRNA has to carefully make it's way to the site of the tRNA. The next step is translation. This step invloves the tRNA to translate the DNA sequence on the mRNA. The third step is the tRNA making it's way to the ribosomes. This step is very important because this step is the step which almost finishes protein synthesis. The last step is when the ribosomes do what the sequence of the DNA says to do.

12098	5	1	1	Transcription, DNA is transcribed into mRNA so it can leave the nuclear membrane. The mRNA passes through the nuclear membrane.The mRNA travels on the endoplasmic riticulum to the ribosome.The ribosome reads the mRNA to figure out what type of protein to make.
12099	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Then it attaches to a ribosomes. Anti codons with amino acids come and attach themselves to the complemantary mRNA codon then ceate tRNA.
12100	5	1	1	Firstly, the RNA strand travels to the ribosomes. Secondly, the Start codon starts the building of the protein. Thirdly, tRNA comes and builds the protein. Lastly, the Stop codon comes along and ends the production of the protein
12118	5	1	1	1.  The mRNA leaves the nucleus because the DNA is to big to fit through the nucleaus pores.2.  The mRNA then separates from the DNA side.3.  A new strand of DNA fills in on the old DNA side.4. A new complete strand of DNA is formed
12128	5	1	1	the are read 3 at a timethey then turn into amino acids they make amino acid chainthen fix the problem
12131	5	1	1	mrna leaves the nucleus then goes to the ribosomes gets protein then goes to the golgi apparatus puts them in their and goes back to the nucleus.
12138	5	1	1	1. The mRNA goes through the cells and meets the tRNA.2. The tRNA matches up its nucleotides with those of the mRNA.3. The tRNA gives the mRNA an amino acid sequence.4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the tRNA reaches a stop codon at the end of the mRNA sequence.
12139	5	1	1	mRNA will go to a ribisomtRNA will conect to the mRNAthe mRNA will brack away from the ribosomeThe mRNA will fold into complex 3d shapes
12140	5	1	1	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, there are four major steps that go on in order for proteins to function properly.                The mRNA travels from the nucleus to the ribosome where ribosmal RNA is present, also known as rRNA. The rRNA then goes to the nuclues where proteins are stored. Then the amino acids bond and then you have a protein.     That is the complete protein synthesis.
12143	5	1	1	mRNA travels to a tRNA and relays that message. Then the tRNA starts to copy the mRNA so the cell can have a replicate. The new mRNA travels to ribosomes. The ribosomes begin to make the protein.
12148	5	1	1	tRNA translates the mRNA strand into a polypeptide strand. That polypeptide strand makes up a protein. That protein helps with cell life processes. And the mRNA strand is translated over and over again.
12149	5	1	1	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to a mitocondria and by using translation, the information is passes to a tRNA which is then used in making proteins. The codons match up with the anticodons. That then allows the creation of proteins.
12168	5	1	1	rRNA decrypts mRNAtRNA gets amino acids to make the protien.
12170	5	1	1	1. Brings the mrna to a ribosome to be remade.2. Mrna goes in ribosome on one end.3. tRNA then comes witha codon oposite of the original and places it together4. The tRNA leaves and Mrna moves to next codon needing to me matched by tRNA. The next correct tRNA links onto the last one creating the protein.
12185	5	1	1	1 anticodon goup matching a codon group attaches 2 the anticodon takes in the information for its purpose3 the anticodon forms the protein5 the protein is made into a chain
12190	5	1	1	mRNA leaves the nuclear envelope.mRNA goes to find the right proteins needed.mRNA brings the proteins back and then tRNA startstRNA puts the proteins torgether using the right code.
12194	5	1	1	It sends information from the nerve system to the brain. It takes proteins across the cell membrane. It takes the DNA to the seqence. It also adds peptides to the chain.
12198	5	1	1	First tRna makes the message. Then mRNA takes the messages to the ribosomes. Then rRNA tells the ribosomes to make the protien.Then the protein is made by the ribosomes.
12201	5	1	0	mRNA is then translated into tRNA and taken back into the nucleous and made into strand of DNA which is attached to the original strand of DNA
12209	5	1	1	The mRNA enters the cytoplasm. The mRNA attaches to ribosomes. Then an anticodon (transport RNA) attaches to the mRNA codons matching the sequence of nucleotides. The process shifts and continues to produce proteins.
12218	5	1	0	-mRNA leaves the nucleus and tRNA steps in to translate the sequence-rRNA create ribosomes for the sequence along with realting to amino acids-the sequence is let out of the cell-it goes off into the organism's body
12221	5	1	1	Transcription- the mRNA changes form.Duplication- the RNA strand is duplicated and then forms new segments of RNA which code for DNA.Translation- the mRNA meets up at the ribosome and tRNA are produced.
12223	5	1	1	mRNA leaves nucleus Leaves with information on how to make the proteins information is translated proteins are made
12228	5	1	1	First, DNA responsible for this unzip, and nitrogen bases pair up with the DNA bases. The mRNA takes this section to tRNA to form codons that can be used in protein synthesis. The codons are matched up with anticodons at ribosomes, and amino acids are made from these. When the amino acids are completed and form the right chain, they are traken and used for their needed purpose.
12229	5	1	1	mRNA gives the information to the tRNA who translates it and shows it to the rRNA, who builds the protein.
12231	5	1	1	During protein synthesis the mRNA first leaves the nucleus.  It then goes on to the Golgi Apparatus.  The next step is the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).  After the mRNA leaves the ER it makes its way to the nucleus.
12241	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome. There the mRNA then tell the tRNA the code to create the proteins. Then the tRNA starts to make the protiens. And finally the proteins are sent out to do their job.
12244	5	1	1	First major step is going through the nucleas, the Second major step is golgi apparatus, third major step is rough ERand the fourth major step is going through the mitochondria, the mitochondria packages it and distributes.
12248	5	1	1	Firtst, mRNA leaves the nucleus and attaches iself to a free ribosome. Then, the sequence has amino acids come and are attached by an enzyme to the RNA strand, and after the protein stand has been made the RNA releases itself from the ribosome so the process can be repeated.
12256	5	1	1	tRNA matches its anticodons with mRNA codons. tRNA gets the corresponding amino acid. Then brings the acid back to the corresponding mRNA.
12257	5	1	1	1. mRNA attatchs itself to a ribosome 2. mRNA discloses the genetic information to the ribosome3. The corresponding nucleotides are put together with the information4. The new chain becomes the new protein
12261	5	1	0	First, it takes the instructions from the nucleus for a sequence of amino acid.Second, it brings them back to the ribosomes and starts protein synthesisThird, the ribosomes start to synthesize protein using the instructions.Fourth, they release the proteins after synthesizing them.
12262	5	1	2	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus after being transcribed from half a single strand of DNA. Then the small and large ribosomes come attach to the RNA to translate it. The codons are then translated into a certain amino acid and the small and large ribosomes pull the needed amino acid over and then slide to the next codon. This happens multiple times until there is a long chain of amino acids that make a protein.
12276	5	1	1	mRNA takes genetic information out of the cell.tRNA brings amino acids with complementary codons to attach      to the mRNA strand.tRNA balances the chemical amounts that come with the amino acids.A protein is created with the new nucleotide sequence.
12287	5	1	1	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA will go to a ribosome.  After the mRNA is at the ribosome, it will enter the ribosome.  After the mRNA has entered the ribosome, it will share the genetic information it is carrying with the tRNA.  After the tRNA has the genetic information, the tRNA will start bringing in amino acids to great proteins.
12289	5	1	1	The mRNA is the taken to be used by tRNA and mRNA. Then it is lined in rows of codons. Then the tRNA and mRNA form together to read and transfer the message for mRNA message. This is all otherwise known as Translation.
12299	5	1	0	1. the dna is 'unzipped' as the hydrogen bonds are broken2. the dna is replicated on each side3. two new strands are present.
12314	5	1	1	They leave and go to the ribosomes. They produce new DNA they send it back to the Nucleus. They produce new DNA
12317	5	1	1	1. mRNA leaves the cell2. The ribazome reads each segment    3. As the segments are read amino acids coding for each segment come down to the ribazome4. The amino acids attach to each other to form a protein
12318	5	1	1	1. the mRNA gives the code tothe Trna2. The tRNA goes and gets the other half of the DNA strand3.The DNA strand is finished copying4. The Dna molecules are paired with amino acids
12325	5	1	1	They go through transcription. The dna splits into to so it unwinds its self and splits. Now its mRNA and it has to split to fit through the passage way out of the nucleus. Then it foes down into the ribosomes. Here it uses translation and copies itsleft into dna again and makes protines. The mRNA carries intructions for DNA.
12326	5	1	1	As mRNA leaves the nucleus, it sends it to the tRNA to get transfered onto the RNA sequence and be seperated into codons and read into amino acids. The rRNA does the reading and after it is read, sends these codes of sequences into a polypeptide chain to then be transfered back into the DNA sequence.
12335	5	1	1	mRNA goes into the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.The mRNA is copied and can become tRNA.The tRNA is made into a copyable strand of DNA.The DNA is taken back to the nucleus,
12337	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves the DNA and finds a ribisom there it is copied and reproduced.
12347	5	1	1	mRNA attatches to a ribosome then the ribosome makes the protein its told to make. After that the protien is sent to the Rough E.R. then after that it is altered a little bit and sent out to the Golgi Apparatus. Then the Golgi Apparatussends the protien to where it has to go and then the protien starts doing its job.
12351	5	1	1	1.mRNA start a process called translation2.tRNA bring Adenine, uracil, cytosine, and guanine to the site3.The bases are attached to the mRNA creating a nucleotide4.The nucleotides are folded into their proper shape.
12353	5	1	1	The mRNA gives the information to the tRNA. The tRNA then translate the information for the rRNA. The rRNA translates the information once again. Then the rRNA Has the Amino acid which is given back to the nucleus.
12356	5	1	1	1) goes through a pore2) meets with transfer RNA3) connets with a ribosome4) returns to the nucleus
12366	5	1	1	After the mRNA leaves it goes to the ribosome and the tRNA brings amino acids to the mRNA.

12386	5	1	1	1.mRNA leaves the nucleus2.It carries it to the ribosomes3.tRNA then  transfers the sequence 4.Then amino acids then split into separate proteins.
12388	5	1	1	After the mRNA leaves the cell nucleus it goes to the rRNA. once the rRNA has the information it will start making protiens and their codons. After codons and proteins are made the cell now has new DNA.
12396	5	1	1	There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.
12404	5	1	1	The mRNA goes RRNA and gives them instruvtions from DNA for the amino acid sequence . Ribosomal RNA makes the ribosomes. TRNA puts the proteins into order to match them up with their correct codon. Prpteins match up with the correct codon, which makes the identical sequence to what DNA needs.

12428	5	1	1	The nucleous gets the information to send out to tell what the cell needs. Then the mRNA take that information and gives it to the ribosome. Then the ribosome makes that information. Then the ribosome puts that information into a strand that looks like a sipper.
12432	5	1	1	One step is when the mRNA goes out of the nucleus. Another step is the mRNA travels through ribosomes. The next step is the mRNA gets its second strand. The final step is the mRNA is now a complete chromosome
12437	5	1	1	First is translation to become mRNA. Then it will leave the cell and go to first a ribosome then to a mitochondria. The mitochondria will then form the mRNA into a protein.

11893	5	0	0	well you might have to go through the cleanins and purifing stage
11895	5	0	0	the mRNA delivers the message so its like the messenager.
11896	5	0	0	The mRNA leaves the nucles and is then coped by ribosomes and is turned into the protein.
11897	5	0	0	The mrRNA then moves to the mitochondria. From there the mitochondria reads the sequence of mRNA. Once the sequence is read a supplementary copy is made. The supplementary copy is then synthesized by the mitochondria.
11898	5	0	0	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus it gets strands then it creates sequences and they turn into amino acids. After turning into amino acids they become energy.
11899	5	0	0	LEAVES NUCLEUS, ENTERS BODY, DELIVERS MESSAGES ABOUT AMINO ACID SEQUENCE, HEADS BACK TO NUCLEUS
11900	5	0	0	It would go through the nucleus and it would send the mRNA to tRna and the tRNA would transfer it to rRna.
11901	5	0	0	First, the newly formed mRNA branches away from the stand of DNA. Second, the information carried by the mRNA is transported to a new cell. Third, the information carried by the mRNA is copied into the new cell. Lastly, the cell then creates the DNA structures that were copied.
11902	5	0	0	DNA, TRNA, RRNA, & AMINO ACIDS
11904	5	0	0	mRNAtRNArRNA
11905	5	0	0	mRNA there is the protein synthesis that go's throw the mRNA and you got your nuclis and your cells and the moliculs
11906	5	0	0	RNA leaves the nucleus. Then it brings back protien
11907	5	0	0	tranlsation, transcription, transformation
