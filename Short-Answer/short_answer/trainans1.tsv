The cell could move to a certain location to ''get away'' from the particular substance being produced in it''s current area.3. The cells pores have a gateway to them that could allow certain substances to get in and others to stay out.'

14841	6	0	0	'There are three known processes used by cells to control treh movement of substances across treh cell membrane. One of these ways is that treh cell forms itself around treh substance and then closes in, with treh cell membrane moving around it, therefore positioning it inside treh cell. Another way is that treh cell ''opens up'' when treh substance or substances come in contact and then ''closing'' after it reaches across treh cell membrane. Another way is that treh cell would move to it, and then absorbs it, in a way of speech.'

Diffusion is another way cells get in and out of the cells. Is where the cell, depending on it''s size,  will determine whether or not that it is able to move throughout the cell.3. The other one is where the nuclear envolope sends a messeges and tells the membrane what to do from there.'
