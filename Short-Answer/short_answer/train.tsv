11375	5	1	2	When the mRNA leaves the nucleous, it is taking a copy of the DNA to make more copies and create a protein. As it leaves, it goes into the ribosome where the protein synthesis and copying of the DNA actually happens. In the ribosome, amino acids with the corresponding letters match up to the new copy of the DNA. Stop codons are added to the end and a protein is now made.
11376	5	1	1	Four major steps in protien synthesis are the chains such as the electron tranport chain. The protiens copy themselves and create amino acids. The chain will continue to make as many amino acids as necessary until it reaches the stop codon. mRNA is the type of RNA that sends a message from the nucleus to the RNA strand so it has directions of what and how to make protiens.
11383	5	1	1	mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads over to the protein. The proteins then connect to thier matches. The mRna carries dna infromation to the ribosome. Then there is a PROTEIN.
11386	5	1	1	The mRNA then travels to a ribosome and attaches to it. One of end of the mRNA goes into the ribosome and tRNA attaches the corresponding nucleotides to the end. Once the mRNA has been coded the corresponding RNA is then copied again to get the correct sequence. The newly made protein is then released from the ribosome.
11398	5	1	1	mRNA finds tRNA and it decodes the mRNA then tRNA goes to rRNA and makes ribosomes.
11406	5	1	1	The mRNA goes to the ribsosomes.The Ribsosomes make a templet.tRNA finds the parts to make the protiensmRNA goes with the ribsosomes to make the protiens
11407	5	1	1	mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes and tells them to make proteins, the ribosomes then start to create the proteins, which are then transfered to the nucleus to be programmed for whatever they are needed for.
11416	5	1	1	Protein synthesis has four steps that involve the mRNA going from the nucleus to the ribosome, and then going from the ribosome to the cell membrane and then to the cytoplasm.
11425	5	1	1	mRNA leaves the nucleus, then it is copied into rRNA and tRNA carrying an amino acid attatch to the nucleic acid in segments of three. The tRNA attatches to certain nucliotide sequences that code for the protein attatched to it and then body form between the amino acids as more tRNA come and once the bond forms between the amino acid the tRNA is let go. By the end of the RNA chain a long string of amino acids has been created
11433	5	1	1	after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is taken to the ribosome by tRNA and it is made into proteins
11434	5	1	1	1. The mRna tells the Trna to get ready at the ribosome2. The Trna goes and attaches the pairs together3. They keep attaching until it hits stop codon4. The protein is released
11436	5	1	1	the mRNA goes to the ribosome and gives the potien codes to the ribosomal RNA
11441	5	1	1	The mRNA that was copied from the DNA leaves the nucleus. It goes to the ribosome, where it is transcripted. Each codon codes for an amino acid. The proteins are linked together as they are translated.
11447	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves the nucleus with the transcribed DNA, which forms RNA, and takes it to the rRNA which is the ribosomal RNA. The rRNA takes it to tRNA to be read. tRNA stands for transfer RNA. tRNA reads and changes the codons to amino acids.
11450	5	1	0	Protein synthesis consists of the building of amino acids. Then they link together forming a chain.Next the chains attach together.Lastly, they turn into the new RNA.
11455	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves the cell and goes into the cytoplasm of the cell. Then, the codon and anti-codon pairs up. Then the anti-codon is released. Then onece it reaches a stop codon there is a chain of amino acids.
11457	5	1	1	The first step is leaving the nucleus. This step is important because the mRNA goes through the nuclear pores to go to the cell. The next step is sending the message through the cell.
11464	5	1	1	The mRNA decodes DNA, then takes the code to the cytoplasm, then takes it to the ribosomes to produce function and then takes it to the tRNA to decode and produce protiens/
11467	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves and sends the tRNA to the DNA. The tRNA leaves amino acids in a chain onto the new DNA. The amino acids form together to make enzymes, which form into protein.
11468	5	1	0	1. the mrna arrive to where the sequence will be decoded. 2. the sequence will be decoded3. they will turn into amino acids sequence for protiens4. the amino acids will make protiens
11476	5	1	1	The mRNA first leaves the nucleus and enters into the cytoplasm. Second, each tRNA carries one amino acid to the anticodons. After thi,s the tRNA helps to form polypeptide bonds between the amino acids. The proteins continue to grow and bond until a stop codon is reached.
11480	5	1	1	It then goes to the RNA strand and sends the message.Then it leaves there and goes to the tRNA and sends the message, which then the tRNA starts to make amino acids.The amino acids then connect to make a peptide bond.Then it starts over agian.
11486	5	1	1	mRNA takes the message that it needs more proteins and makes sure that it gets to the ribosomes, where the proteins are made. the ribosomes start making proteins and when they are done send the proteins for their final packaging to the Golgi Apparatus. The Golgi polisheses and finishes the synthesis of the proteins and send them out in the cell where the are needed.
11491	5	1	1	The mRNA goes through the nuclear pores and delivers the message. The message is then processed and the cells completes the task.
11504	5	1	1	The mRNA goes to ribosomes that read it.Ribosomes send a message to tRNA.The tRNA take take a amino acid.Connecting them making a codon.
11505	5	1	1	First, the mRNA move through the cytoplasma to the ribosome. Then the tRNA take over by making another side.Then the tRNA take it to the ribosome to get cut by restiction enzymes. Then those peices get turned into pieces of protien.
11511	5	1	1	the RNA takes the sequence to the ribosomes to make protien
11512	5	1	1	1. The trna attaches itself to the mrna2.The mrna takes the trna to the line of nuleic acids.3. the mrna detatches onto the line.4. the trna attacthes a new ribosome to itself back to the nuleus to start over.
11513	5	1	1	the mRNA is copied and then sent out by the ribosomes. then goes through the endoplasmic reticioulm where it does its job.
11515	5	1	1	Mrna connects to the ribosomeCodons read the letters then retrieve the correct amino acidThe amino acids are connnected to the mrna and taken into the ribosomeIn the ribosome the amino acids are used to make a protien
11524	5	1	1	-Translation:  moving out of the nucleus into the other parts of the cell-Fusion:  RNA moves to amino acids-Replication:  copying the sequence to replicate the DNA-Reaches stop codon:  the stop codon stops the sequence from being replicated any further.
11525	5	1	1	1.After the mRNA leaves the nucleus ,it goes to the ribsome where the tRNA is.2.When at the ribosome,the mRNA transfers the data to the amino acid sequence in the tRNA.3.After transfering, the data goes through protein chains fulled by ATP. 4.After completing all the steps,the protien is sent throught the body for energy.
11526	5	1	1	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is cut in half and the anticodons are read. After that, tRNA brings codons to bond with them. The Amino acid all chain together. Last thepolypeptide chain breaks away forming a protein.
11536	5	1	0	The mRNA leaves the nucleus.  The cells travel to a ribosome to make proteins.  Then, the proteins travel to the mitochondia to make energy.  Then, the cell leaves the mitochondia and makes it way to the amino acids.
11542	5	1	1	mRNA leavign the nucleaus, the mRNA attaches to the new protein, then matches up the complemetary codons.
11543	5	1	1	The first major step is to find a Ribsome. Next would be to attach to the Ribsome. After that tRNA goes and gets amino acids. The last major step would be to make a long chain of amino acids and turn that into a protein.
11545	5	1	1	First, mRNA takes the codes to the ribosome to make the proteins. Then, the rRNA codes for the proteins and makes them. Then the tRNA transfers the proteins back to the nucleus. Finally, the proteins are released into the cytoplasm, and the process begins again.
11549	5	1	1	The mRNA departs to from the cell to the ribosomes and with instructions of how many and what types of proteins to make for the cell. The mRNA contains a sequence of what types of amino acids consist in the protein that is to be made.
11553	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves the nucleus.The mRNA travels to the ribosome.The ribosome attaches to the mRNA.tRNA attaches codons to the anti-codons on the mRNA.
11554	5	1	1	the mRNA goes to the ribosomes. at the ribosomes the mRNA changes in to tRNA. The tRNA leaves the ribosomes and goes to the golgi apparatus to be changed to protein. the protein then gets sent to all parts of the body.
11558	5	1	1	The RNA leaves the nucleus and then sends codes to the DNA telling it what its new match will be, switching the A's to U's. T's go with A's G's with C's and visversa except the A will switch to a U instead of a T. This is known as mRNA. Then the mRNA sends codes to the proteins telling what codon it will be.example:DNA: ATGTACCGTATGACTmRNA: UAC-AUG-GCA-UAC-UGA(after RNA happens)Amino acid: Tyr, Met (technically you start with a Met), Ala, Tyr, STOP
11560	5	1	1	The mRNA goes to the ribosomes which then code for codons, then taken to the amino acids sending it back to the nucleus to recreate new strands of DNA.
11566	5	1	1	First the mRNA is sent from the nucleus and sent to the ribosomes. Than it is changed into tRNA. After it is turned into tRNA it is sent to be turned into protein. Than when it is turned into a protein it is sent into the body to do it's job.
11567	5	1	1	mRNA leaves the nucleus and hooks up with another mRNA. Then one of the strands breaks off, and another tRNA strand hooks up with it.
11568	5	1	0	DNA separates and an RNA strand is paired with DNA strandThe RNA is taken to the ribosomeThe RNA is then changed to mRNAThen the mRNA is tranlated into tRNAand then you have a strand of RNA
11571	5	1	1	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus with a pattern2. mRNA goes to a ribosome3. tRNA comes and makes a complimetary strand4. rRNA makes the amino acid sequence to create protein
11580	5	1	1	1. mRNA goes and connects with a tRNA.2. the anti codons attach to its same sequence.3. the anti codon and the codon make a protein.4. the protein is matched with others and goes through the protein channel.
11587	5	1	1	mRNA then heads to the ribosomes where it is transcribed using the codes to create amino acid strands which are connected. A long enough chain of amino acids create proteins.
11592	5	1	1	The next step that is involved in protein synthesis would be after the mRNA leaves the nucleus the tRNA sends instructions to the ribosomes in order to create the protein. Which is where the DNA is then unzipped. The codons are then attached with the one strand of DNA. Once this has happend the amino acids then match up with their complementary bases to form the amino acid sequence, in order to form a protein.
11594	5	1	1	When mRNA leaves the nucleus it transfers to tRNA. Then it makes amino acids. Then the amino acids make a peptide bond, Then the cycle repeats.
11599	5	1	1	1.) mRNA is transcribed into tRNA2.) codons form in sections of 3 nucleotides with a 'stop' codon at the end3.) tRNA plugs into the codons and starts making the amino acids4. amino acids form into proteins
11607	5	1	1	1. mRNA is transported to the ribosomes2. rRNA matches it with the amino acid that corresponds to form proteins
11610	5	1	2	As the mRNA leaves the nuclear pore a rRNA comes and aids the process. The tRNA comes and has complementary codons to make a amino acid. Then another tRNA comes and copies the next segment on the mRNA to makes a different amino acid. This is done with the ribosomal RNA at each segment being copied. After doing this process for awhile it forms a polypeptide or protien.
11611	5	1	1	The tRNA then carries the aminos to the polypeptide chain. After that the enzyme helps bond the chain together. The DNA is formed having the original strand that has the codes for the new strand to be formed. Each DNA strand then has a new and original strand.
11616	5	1	1	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus. When it enters the cytoplasm, the ribosomes meet up with it and it begins protein synthesis. The tRNA matches up with it, and the amino acids are formed. After the opposite strand is made, they break apart and you have a strand of amino acids.
11621	5	1	1	First the mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then an enzyme unzipps the mRNA. The third step is an amino acids line up with the corresponding codons. When it reaches the stop codon the amino acids break off together forming a protein.
11634	5	1	1	mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes out into the cell to find a ribosome. Once the ribosome receives information from the nucleus to make a new protein, it beings to unzip. Floating nucleotides in the cytoplasm come in and connect with the RNA that is being created.
11636	5	1	1	1. mRNA leaves nucleus headed toward the ribosome.2. It tranfers into tRNA.3. That attaches to the ribosome.4. There it is changed to rRNA
11638	5	1	1	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus2. mRNA travels to the ER3. tRNA gives mRNA information 4. mRNA replicates into an exact clone of the existing DNA
11640	5	1	1	Step 1: The transcription of mRNA from a DNA geneStep 2: Translation occurs at the ribosomes in the cells cytoplasm.Step 3: Elongation of the peptide begins as various tRNA's reach the next codonStep 4: the protein is synthesised
11655	5	1	0	First translation starts. Then the codons are made. Codons are matched up. Finaly RNA starts again.
11666	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and to the ribosome.  There it gives the message to start protein synthesis.  The protein recieves the messages and the ribosome begins to synthesis it.
11667	5	1	1	the mrna then is copied except for the thymine that is changed to uracil. and it moves to the ribosomes and is helped made into a protein then the trna goes to the cell
10971	5	2	2	First thing the mRNA does is go to the ribosome.  Next, the tRNA comes and decodes the first three nucleotides.  Then, the tRNA brings over the amino acid that matches the codon.  Last, the tRNA shifts over and the amino acids form peptide bonds with one another.
10996	5	2	2	1. The mRNA attaches to a ribosome, to begin protein synthesis.2. The correct amino acid attaches to the first part of the MRNA in the P-site, while in the A-site another amino acid waits.3. The ribosome keeps moving intil a stop codon is reached and stops.
11046	5	2	2	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it takes the information needed to make a protein to the ribosome. After that the ribosme reads the mRNA code. Then the complimentary tRNA, with its specific amino acid comes in and attatches itself with the mRNA strand. Peptide bonds are put inbetween the amino acids and it folds up in a certain way to make a protein.
11083	5	2	2	1) The mRNA attaches to a ribosome because protein synthiesis takes place in the ribosome.2) Corresponding tRNA attaches to the mRNA where the nitrogenous bases match up.3) These nitrogenous bases code for an amino acid.4) A protein is formed by a strain of amino acids joined by petide bonds.
11103	5	2	2	1) mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the free ribosomes.2) tRNA carrying the anticodon bonds to the mRNA codon in the ribosome.3) new amino acids are formed by the bonding of the codon and the anticodon. 4) the amino acids bind together into macromolecules called proteins.
11148	5	2	2	1. The mRNA goes to the ribosome.2. The ribosome attaches to the mRNA.3. The tRNA comes and attaches to the mRNA, to begin protein synthesis.4. Protein synthesis continues until a stop codon signals to stop.
11157	5	2	2	1. mRNA travels to the ribosomes2. tRNA creates codons from anticodons3. rRNA inteprates the codons and the ribosome makes amino acids4. Amino acids link together and form a protein
11208	5	2	2	1. The first step is when the mRNA releases from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.2. Next the cytoplasm that has the mRNA in it will attach to a ribosome.3. That ribosome will soon make a peptide bond between the first and second amino acid.4. This will continue until it reaches a stop codon.
11313	5	2	2	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads directly to the ribosome where the ribosome matches the codons to their complementry base pairs. The amino acids on the ends of the tRNA are linked to gether by polypeptide chains and soon a stop codon cuts off the amino acids making a protien.
11368	5	2	2	The first big step in protein synthesis is the mRNA leaving the nuclues through nuclear pores. The second big step is finding a ribsome to decode the mRNA. Next, tRNA moves in and adds the anti-codon to start making a protein. The anti-codons are joined by amino acids. To finish the process, a tRNA leaves and the ribosome moves down the mRNA to the next codon. A new tRNA brings a new anti-codon.
11410	5	2	2	1) The mRNA will take the genetic code to a ribosome.2) tRNA comes to the ribosome and matches it`s codon with the respective codons of the mRNA, dropping one molecule of amino acid as it goes3) The amino acid collects, forming a long string of amino acid4) The ribosome takes in the amino acid and creates protein
11466	5	2	2	The mRNA goes into the cytoplasm and experiences transcription, which is the pairing of bases according to the mRNA sequence. Then the full strand is split, and both strands go to the ribosomes to be translated. When the mRNA strands arrive there, translation will occur, which means that tRNA will bring amino acids that code for a particular segment of the mRNA, will attach together. A certain number of the amino acids will then code for a proteins.
11529	5	2	2	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes.  At the ribosomes tRNA attatches to the appropriate sequences on the mRNA.  On the other side of the tRNA are the amino acid that the nucleotide sequence on the other side codes for.  This happens continuously to make proteins.
11564	5	2	1	It goes to the ribosome and tRNA carrying a amino acid comes in and if the code matches then the amino acid stays and then this process continues until u get a stop codon. The end result is the making of a proteine
11565	5	2	2	1. The mRNA settles on the endoplasmic reticulum.2. The mRNA finds a match of tRNA.3. The two produce a chain of amino acids.4. The chain of amino acids create a protein.
11639	5	2	1	mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. When traveling the cytoplasm it connects to a ribosome. The ribosomes reads off the mRNA as a codon(three at a time)each codon coding for a amino acid. tRNA travels along the mRNA and carries anti-codons to connect with the codons. The codons and anti-codons are then connected making a strand of protein.
11659	5	2	2	1.The mRNA attaches onto a ribosome.2. The ribosome reads the mRNA's code by three letters at a time, three letters strung together are called a codon.3.Each tRNA molecule has one of the many anticodons, the complementary code of a codon, attached to them. Once the rRNA reads a codon, the tRNA with the correct anticodon will attach onto the ribosome.4. The anticodon is put on a string attached to the ribosome that when put together with the other anticodons later to come make a certain protein. The tRNA is released from the ribosome.
11720	5	2	3	In protein sythesis the mRNA travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm. There, a ribosome reads the code on the mRNA. As the ribosome reads the code, tRNA find free amino acids and bring them to the mRNA to be arranged. When they are arranged they form peptide bonds that help them to serve their function as a protein.
11731	5	2	2	Next, tRNA change the RNA strands from As,Ts, Cs, and Gs to As, Us, Cs, and Gs so that it can be read by something that I can't remember. But then it's changed back to its original state and paired with anti-codons that are attached to amino acids. The anti-codons break off so that only the amino acid remains. Once the anti-codons reach the stop codon, the amino acid chain breaks off and is now a protein.
11757	5	2	2	The mRNA comes to the ribosme where then the DNA is decoded by tRNA. The tRNA then tanslates the codons which then attaches the correct amino acid to the tRNA. Each of the segments have their own amino acid which they then all are bonded by peptide bonds to create a protein.
11903	5	2	2	When mRNA, also known as the messanger RNA, leaves the nucleous and attaches onto an rRNA, ribosome, the rRNA matches the mRNA to a tRNA.  The ribosome takes three mRNA at a time and docks them untill the tRNA comes with the match and each match has a code.  The code AUG means to start that way the body knows when to start protein synthesis.
11940	5	2	2	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome. Then, tRNA that fits comes and attaches to the mRNA. The tRNA then builds up into Amino Acids that link together to become a protein.
10981	5	3	3	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome. Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome. The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon. Also, the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction. This process is repeated until a stop code is reached.
10992	5	3	3	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded. The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome. The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for. A strand of mRNA can be translated several times.
11304	5	3	3	1.  The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2.  tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it.  It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.  3.  The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4.  The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins.
11320	5	3	3	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through the cytoplasm and hooks onto a ribosome. At the ribosome, the tRNA comes and matchs the codons with anti-codons. When the anti-codons have been set on the codons the tRNA then brings over the amino acids that match the codons or anti-codons. They are then held together by a peptide bond.
11377	5	3	2	After the mRNA leave the nucleus, there are four other major steps involved in protein synthesis. First, a tRNA attaches to the strand of mRNA. The first codon of nucleotide bases on the mRNA match the codon on the tRNA. The tRNA codes for an amino acid. Next, another tRNA connects to the next codon, bringing in another amino acid. The first tRNA floats away, leaving the amino acid behind. The amino acids bond. This continues, creating a strand of amino acids, until a stop codon is reached. Then the chain of amino acids is released.
11573	5	3	3	1) tRNA reads the strand of mRNA using anticodons.2) tRNA retrieves amino acids.3) The process continues until a stop codon is reached.4) The newly formed polypeptide is released.
11635	5	3	3	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome and gets attached to it. Next, tRNA comes along and attaches it's anti-codons to the mRNA's codons. Then, an amino acid is created and the tRNA strand leaves and another one is attached to the next three codons. Thus, creation another amino acid and the amino acids are held together in a chain by peptide bonds. The chain that is created is a protein.
11682	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mRNA codes for.  In the ribosome the mRNA is read in the sequence of codons and calls the tRNA to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon.  The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain.  When the protien chain is complete it goes out into the cytoplasm and goes where ever it is needed in the cell or outside of the cell.
11721	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it enters into the cytoplasm, where it docks at a ribosome made of rRNA. Next, tRNA reads the codons and using its anticodons goes out into the cytoplasm to pick up the amino acid that corresponds. It then travels back to the mRNA and connects its amino acid with the one previously set before it. Once the tRNA reaches the stop codon, the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed.
11723	5	3	3	The mRNA finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on.  Once the mRNA finds the ribosome the AUG codon starts the protein synthesis.  Next, tRNA bring the correct anti-codons to the mRNA for the construction of the protein.  Once the tRNA have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons.  The anti-codons are then paired up the the codons on the mRNA strand, and peptide bonds form between each of the anticodons.  When the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made.
11733	5	3	3	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it. Second, the ribosome reads every three nucleotide sequence, or codon, and calls for a tRNA molecule that has an anticodon to compliment the codon. Third, after this process is repeated, the amino acids on the tRNA molecules form peptide bonds with each other, forming a protein. Finally, after the mRNA is translated until a stop codon, the protein is released and used in the cell as needed.
11741	5	3	3	Next, mRNA attaches to a ribosome where the code on it will be translated to the order of amino acids needed to make a protein.  rRNA combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.  tRNA finds amino acids that match with the code it carries and takes carries them to the ribosome where it matches its amino acids to the code on teh mRNA.  All of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein.
11762	5	3	3	The first stepis mRNA connects to the ribosome to keep it in place.  Secondly tRNA brings the anticodons and they match with the bases pair.  On the third step another tRNA brings another anticodon and the amino acids at the end stick togather. And the fourth step is that these steps are repeated and all the amino acids stick together and form a protein until they get to the stop codon.
11780	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it meets up with a RNA polymerase which begins to read the sequence at a start codon. As it reads the mRNA codons and tRNA begin bringing amino acids as they are called for by the mRNA. These amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mRNA. Once it reaches the stop codon, it stops and the new protein made of all te amino acids is taken away.
11819	5	3	3	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, 1. it goes to the endoplasmic reticulum where protein synthesis begins.  2. Ribosomes then move in to begin the process of synthesis where anticodons are moved on to the correct codons transferring the correct amino acid code that is to be made. 3. the amino acid is made and attached to all other amino acids beside it with Peptide bonds. 4. A stop codon tells the amino acids to stop and the previous amino acid becomes the last in the chain, making a complete protein.
11830	5	3	3	After the the mRNA leaves the cells nuclaer envolope throught the pores in the envolope the m RNA seeks out a ribosome ( an organelle that synthisize protien based on the codons it get for the messenge RNA)  to synthisize the proteins it has codons for. After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal. After the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used
11846	5	3	3	First, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome and then the ribosome reads the mRNA in segments of three, called codons. For each codon, there is a complementary amino acid. Secondly, tRNA picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome. Thirdy, the amino acids attach to each other and form a chain of amino acids according to the way in which the codons are read on the mRNA strand by the ribosome. The chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon on the mRNA strand. Lastly, the ribosome disconnects from the mRNA strand and the protein is relased to perform its job in the cell.
11868	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nuclues, it goes to ribosomal RNA. Each tRNA anticodon is attached to an amino acid found in the cytoplasm and comes to the rRNA. The tRNA forms the complement of the mRNA strand, and the attached amino acids connect to one another until a STOP codon is reached.
11872	5	3	3	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosome where rRNA recognizes the mRNA strand and a start codon and coordinates the ribosome to attache to the mRNA.2. Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome. From there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly.
12020	5	1	1	The mRNA goes to the ribosomes to deliver the genetic code from the nucleus.  The ribsomes connect the nucleic acids and send it to the Golgi Apparatus.  Then the Gogli aparatus gets rid of the bad proteins.  Then gets the good proteins ready to be used in the cell.
12021	5	1	1	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Then, it is bonded to a ribosome and it starts to decode the mRNA. Next, the different nucleic acids arrive and match up with the mRNA codons. Last, the amino acid is formed, and the process continues at the Endoplasmic Reticulum where, eventually, all those amino acids make up a protein.
12023	5	1	1	The mRNA must first go to the ribosome. then the ribosome makes what ever it was told to make. After that tRNA come and transport the protien to its destenation.
12047	5	1	1	Step 1, the mRNA leaves the nucleus. Step 2, the protein is sent to the ribosomes. Step 3 , the protein is the synthesized, and step 4, the mRNA returns the synthesized protein to the nucleus.
12048	5	1	1	mRNA copies it's self with DNA to make a codon strand mRNA sends information to the tRNA the tRNA then translates the codons the rRNA produces proteins
12061	5	1	1	Transcrpition, translation, tRNA carrying amino acids and anticodons enter and make a peptide chain, peptide chain is formed when peptide bonds are added between the amino acids.
12064	5	1	1	The mRNA is translated into tRNA. Then, the ribosomes helps with protein synthesis by transcribing the tRNA into amino acids which then are put together to make proteins which are then formed into polypeptides.
12085	5	1	1	When mRNA leavs the nucleus the mRNA must find rhibosomes to tell them how to make protein. When the mRNA finds the rhibosomes the RNA helps them make the protein. One of the major steps is to find out what the mRNA was told to do by the DNA. When the rhibosomes find out what the mRNA has told them they go to work.
12095	5	1	1	After leaving the nucleus, the mRNA has to carefully make it's way to the site of the tRNA. The next step is translation. This step invloves the tRNA to translate the DNA sequence on the mRNA. The third step is the tRNA making it's way to the ribosomes. This step is very important because this step is the step which almost finishes protein synthesis. The last step is when the ribosomes do what the sequence of the DNA says to do.
12096	5	1	0	1) mRNA leaves the nucleus.2) mRNA travels into the cytoplasm 3) mRNA is translated into tRNA 4)tRNA makes another strand to make another cell.
12098	5	1	1	Transcription, DNA is transcribed into mRNA so it can leave the nuclear membrane. The mRNA passes through the nuclear membrane.The mRNA travels on the endoplasmic riticulum to the ribosome.The ribosome reads the mRNA to figure out what type of protein to make.
12099	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Then it attaches to a ribosomes. Anti codons with amino acids come and attach themselves to the complemantary mRNA codon then ceate tRNA.
12100	5	1	1	Firstly, the RNA strand travels to the ribosomes. Secondly, the Start codon starts the building of the protein. Thirdly, tRNA comes and builds the protein. Lastly, the Stop codon comes along and ends the production of the protein
12118	5	1	1	1.  The mRNA leaves the nucleus because the DNA is to big to fit through the nucleaus pores.2.  The mRNA then separates from the DNA side.3.  A new strand of DNA fills in on the old DNA side.4. A new complete strand of DNA is formed

12138	5	1	1	1. The mRNA goes through the cells and meets the tRNA.2. The tRNA matches up its nucleotides with those of the mRNA.3. The tRNA gives the mRNA an amino acid sequence.4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the tRNA reaches a stop codon at the end of the mRNA sequence.
12139	5	1	1	mRNA will go to a ribisomtRNA will conect to the mRNAthe mRNA will brack away from the ribosomeThe mRNA will fold into complex 3d shapes
12140	5	1	1	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, there are four major steps that go on in order for proteins to function properly.                The mRNA travels from the nucleus to the ribosome where ribosmal RNA is present, also known as rRNA. The rRNA then goes to the nuclues where proteins are stored. Then the amino acids bond and then you have a protein.     That is the complete protein synthesis.
12143	5	1	1	mRNA travels to a tRNA and relays that message. Then the tRNA starts to copy the mRNA so the cell can have a replicate. The new mRNA travels to ribosomes. The ribosomes begin to make the protein.
12148	5	1	1	tRNA translates the mRNA strand into a polypeptide strand. That polypeptide strand makes up a protein. That protein helps with cell life processes. And the mRNA strand is translated over and over again.
12149	5	1	1	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to a mitocondria and by using translation, the information is passes to a tRNA which is then used in making proteins. The codons match up with the anticodons. That then allows the creation of proteins.
12168	5	1	1	rRNA decrypts mRNAtRNA gets amino acids to make the protien.
12170	5	1	1	1. Brings the mrna to a ribosome to be remade.2. Mrna goes in ribosome on one end.3. tRNA then comes witha codon oposite of the original and places it together4. The tRNA leaves and Mrna moves to next codon needing to me matched by tRNA. The next correct tRNA links onto the last one creating the protein.

12194	5	1	1	It sends information from the nerve system to the brain. It takes proteins across the cell membrane. It takes the DNA to the seqence. It also adds peptides to the chain.
12198	5	1	1	First tRna makes the message. Then mRNA takes the messages to the ribosomes. Then rRNA tells the ribosomes to make the protien.Then the protein is made by the ribosomes.
12201	5	1	0	mRNA is then translated into tRNA and taken back into the nucleous and made into strand of DNA which is attached to the original strand of DNA
12209	5	1	1	The mRNA enters the cytoplasm. The mRNA attaches to ribosomes. Then an anticodon (transport RNA) attaches to the mRNA codons matching the sequence of nucleotides. The process shifts and continues to produce proteins.
12218	5	1	0	-mRNA leaves the nucleus and tRNA steps in to translate the sequence-rRNA create ribosomes for the sequence along with realting to amino acids-the sequence is let out of the cell-it goes off into the organism's body
12221	5	1	1	Transcription- the mRNA changes form.Duplication- the RNA strand is duplicated and then forms new segments of RNA which code for DNA.Translation- the mRNA meets up at the ribosome and tRNA are produced.
12223	5	1	1	mRNA leaves nucleus Leaves with information on how to make the proteins information is translated proteins are made
12228	5	1	1	First, DNA responsible for this unzip, and nitrogen bases pair up with the DNA bases. The mRNA takes this section to tRNA to form codons that can be used in protein synthesis. The codons are matched up with anticodons at ribosomes, and amino acids are made from these. When the amino acids are completed and form the right chain, they are traken and used for their needed purpose.
12229	5	1	1	mRNA gives the information to the tRNA who translates it and shows it to the rRNA, who builds the protein.
12231	5	1	1	During protein synthesis the mRNA first leaves the nucleus.  It then goes on to the Golgi Apparatus.  The next step is the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).  After the mRNA leaves the ER it makes its way to the nucleus.
12241	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome. There the mRNA then tell the tRNA the code to create the proteins. Then the tRNA starts to make the protiens. And finally the proteins are sent out to do their job.
12244	5	1	1	First major step is going through the nucleas, the Second major step is golgi apparatus, third major step is rough ERand the fourth major step is going through the mitochondria, the mitochondria packages it and distributes.
12248	5	1	1	Firtst, mRNA leaves the nucleus and attaches iself to a free ribosome. Then, the sequence has amino acids come and are attached by an enzyme to the RNA strand, and after the protein stand has been made the RNA releases itself from the ribosome so the process can be repeated.
12256	5	1	1	tRNA matches its anticodons with mRNA codons. tRNA gets the corresponding amino acid. Then brings the acid back to the corresponding mRNA.
12257	5	1	1	1. mRNA attatchs itself to a ribosome 2. mRNA discloses the genetic information to the ribosome3. The corresponding nucleotides are put together with the information4. The new chain becomes the new protein
12261	5	1	0	First, it takes the instructions from the nucleus for a sequence of amino acid.Second, it brings them back to the ribosomes and starts protein synthesisThird, the ribosomes start to synthesize protein using the instructions.Fourth, they release the proteins after synthesizing them.
12262	5	1	2	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus after being transcribed from half a single strand of DNA. Then the small and large ribosomes come attach to the RNA to translate it. The codons are then translated into a certain amino acid and the small and large ribosomes pull the needed amino acid over and then slide to the next codon. This happens multiple times until there is a long chain of amino acids that make a protein.
12276	5	1	1	mRNA takes genetic information out of the cell.tRNA brings amino acids with complementary codons to attach      to the mRNA strand.tRNA balances the chemical amounts that come with the amino acids.A protein is created with the new nucleotide sequence.
12287	5	1	1	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA will go to a ribosome.  After the mRNA is at the ribosome, it will enter the ribosome.  After the mRNA has entered the ribosome, it will share the genetic information it is carrying with the tRNA.  After the tRNA has the genetic information, the tRNA will start bringing in amino acids to great proteins.
12289	5	1	1	The mRNA is the taken to be used by tRNA and mRNA. Then it is lined in rows of codons. Then the tRNA and mRNA form together to read and transfer the message for mRNA message. This is all otherwise known as Translation.
12299	5	1	0	1. the dna is 'unzipped' as the hydrogen bonds are broken2. the dna is replicated on each side3. two new strands are present.
12314	5	1	1	They leave and go to the ribosomes. They produce new DNA they send it back to the Nucleus. They produce new DNA
12317	5	1	1	1. mRNA leaves the cell2. The ribazome reads each segment    3. As the segments are read amino acids coding for each segment come down to the ribazome4. The amino acids attach to each other to form a protein

12325	5	1	1	They go through transcription. The dna splits into to so it unwinds its self and splits. Now its mRNA and it has to split to fit through the passage way out of the nucleus. Then it foes down into the ribosomes. Here it uses translation and copies itsleft into dna again and makes protines. The mRNA carries intructions for DNA.
12326	5	1	1	As mRNA leaves the nucleus, it sends it to the tRNA to get transfered onto the RNA sequence and be seperated into codons and read into amino acids. The rRNA does the reading and after it is read, sends these codes of sequences into a polypeptide chain to then be transfered back into the DNA sequence.
12335	5	1	1	mRNA goes into the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.The mRNA is copied and can become tRNA.The tRNA is made into a copyable strand of DNA.The DNA is taken back to the nucleus,

12347	5	1	1	mRNA attatches to a ribosome then the ribosome makes the protein its told to make. After that the protien is sent to the Rough E.R. then after that it is altered a little bit and sent out to the Golgi Apparatus. Then the Golgi Apparatussends the protien to where it has to go and then the protien starts doing its job.
12351	5	1	1	1.mRNA start a process called translation2.tRNA bring Adenine, uracil, cytosine, and guanine to the site3.The bases are attached to the mRNA creating a nucleotide4.The nucleotides are folded into their proper shape.

12388	5	1	1	After the mRNA leaves the cell nucleus it goes to the rRNA. once the rRNA has the information it will start making protiens and their codons. After codons and proteins are made the cell now has new DNA.
12396	5	1	1	There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.
12404	5	1	1	The mRNA goes RRNA and gives them instruvtions from DNA for the amino acid sequence . Ribosomal RNA makes the ribosomes. TRNA puts the proteins into order to match them up with their correct codon. Prpteins match up with the correct codon, which makes the identical sequence to what DNA needs.
12423	5	1	1	MESSANGER RNA TO ENDOPLACIUM RETICULUM TO RIBOSOMES THEN ATTACHES TO WALL
12428	5	1	1	The nucleous gets the information to send out to tell what the cell needs. Then the mRNA take that information and gives it to the ribosome. Then the ribosome makes that information. Then the ribosome puts that information into a strand that looks like a sipper.
12432	5	1	1	One step is when the mRNA goes out of the nucleus. Another step is the mRNA travels through ribosomes. The next step is the mRNA gets its second strand. The final step is the mRNA is now a complete chromosome
12437	5	1	1	First is translation to become mRNA. Then it will leave the cell and go to first a ribosome then to a mitochondria. The mitochondria will then form the mRNA into a protein.

12449	5	1	1	The mRNA goes to the cytoplasm to look for a ribosome.     The mRNA is then read by the rRNA.     The rRNA tells the tRNA witch amino acid to bring.      The tRNA brings the amino acids to the ribosome where the amino acids will be assembled into proteins.
12457	5	1	1	-leaves the neucleus--attaches itself to a ribosome---reaches mitochondrion----begins protein synthesis
12462	5	1	1	First, the mRNA is released into the body. Then the mRNA attaches itself to ribosomes. Thirdly, the mRNA grows to the biggest size in can go. Lastly, when the mRNA is done growing, it will be delivered to the lysosome where it will be disposed of.
12472	5	1	1	The mRNA leaves the nucleus, then the mRNA goes to the ribosomes.  The mRNA is then translated into DNA.  The DNA makes a strand of proteins.

12513	5	1	1	mRNA is the meesanger RNA. It carries the information out of the cell to the ribosome. Which then takes that information to the protien. Then once it gets to the protien, the protiens starts to go through protien synthesis.

11889	5	0	0	Phospate moves around cell. Active transport lets proteins pass through. Process begins over again.
11890	5	0	0	mRNA leaves the nucleus.
11891	5	0	1	Step 1: mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the cytoplasm.Step 2: rRNA copies the strand of mRNA.Step 3: tRNA takes the copies to get a new strand of nucleotides.Step 4: The mRNA matches up with its tRNA and the nucleotides make a protein.
11892	5	0	0	The first amnio acid comes and attaches to the mRNA then dehydration synthesis occurs. After that the hydrogen bond brakes and that amnio acid goes to find more protien. then that procees continues.
11893	5	0	0	well you might have to go through the cleanins and purifing stage
11895	5	0	0	the mRNA delivers the message so its like the messenager.
11896	5	0	0	The mRNA leaves the nucles and is then coped by ribosomes and is turned into the protein.
11897	5	0	0	The mrRNA then moves to the mitochondria. From there the mitochondria reads the sequence of mRNA. Once the sequence is read a supplementary copy is made. The supplementary copy is then synthesized by the mitochondria.
11898	5	0	0	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus it gets strands then it creates sequences and they turn into amino acids. After turning into amino acids they become energy.
11899	5	0	0	LEAVES NUCLEUS, ENTERS BODY, DELIVERS MESSAGES ABOUT AMINO ACID SEQUENCE, HEADS BACK TO NUCLEUS
11900	5	0	0	It would go through the nucleus and it would send the mRNA to tRna and the tRNA would transfer it to rRna.
11901	5	0	0	First, the newly formed mRNA branches away from the stand of DNA. Second, the information carried by the mRNA is transported to a new cell. Third, the information carried by the mRNA is copied into the new cell. Lastly, the cell then creates the DNA structures that were copied.
