0	0	0	0	0	mRNA goes to the cytoplasm.There, it makes copies of itself.tRNA is made.RNA is connected to a strand of DNA.
3	1	2	2	2	1-the mRNA travels to a ribosome 2-The codons on the mRNA signal for an amino acid3-Translation-tRNA match up an amino acid to each codon on the mRNA starting with the start codon4-termination-the amino acids are matched up with the codons on the mRNA until the stop codon is reached, which signals the end of translation
3	1	2	3	3	Next, mRNA attaches to a ribosome where the code on it will be translated to the order of amino acids needed to make a protein.  rRNA combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.  tRNA finds amino acids that match with the code it carries and takes carries them to the ribosome where it matches its amino acids to the code on teh mRNA.  All of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein.
2	1	2	2	3	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome. Then, tRNA that fits comes and attaches to the mRNA. The tRNA then builds up into Amino Acids that link together to become a protein.
1	0	0	1	3	After leaving the nucleus, mRNA travels through the cell to the golgi apparatus. After that, it goes to the ER.  Then it travels to the golgi apparatus again. Finally, it exits the cell..
1	0	1	1	3	Transcription- the mRNA changes form.Duplication- the RNA strand is duplicated and then forms new segments of RNA which code for DNA.Translation- the mRNA meets up at the ribosome and tRNA are produced.
0					When the mRNA leaves the nucles it travels to the mitochondria to code for the proteins that need to be made.
0					The mRNA sends the genetic code to tRNA. Then, the tRNA takes the genetic code to the ribosomes. The ribosome receives the genetic information and gets help from another mRNA. The ribosome, with the help of mRNA, uses the information to construct the protein that was coded for in the genetic information.
2					1.the mRNA will have to be translated after it leaves the nucleus.2. When the strand is translated tRNA will add anticodons to it.3. tRNA will carry amino acids with it to bind to the strand. 4. the amino acids will bind creating a protein.
2					The ribosome comes to the mRNA strand.  Then two rRNA molecules start to decode the strand.  As it decodes a protien is produced on the outside of the ribosome.  When it reaches the stop codon the protien is finished and the ribosome leaves the mRNA strand.
1					The mRNA goes into the ribosome and transcription occurs. when this occurs, an enzyme
1					mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome, which is where the proteins are made, picks them up, and brings them back to the nucleus.
