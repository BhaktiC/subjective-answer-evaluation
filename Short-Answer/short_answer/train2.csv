10976	5	1	1	first the mRNA leaves the cell nucleus and moves to the ribosome where tRNA finds complementary bases
10978	5	1	1	mRNA leaves the  nucleus. Then it enters the cytoplam, and proceeds to the ER.
10979	5	1	1	1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus.2. The mRNA transports to the reticulum.3. The mRNA hooks onto a DNA.4. The mRNA is transported by the tRNA back to the nucleus,
10982	5	1	1	1.The mRNA sends a message to ribosomes to send anticodons.2. The anticodons place themselves on the matching portion of the mRNA strand.3. The ribosomes begin to create proteins.4. The opposite RNA strand of the original mRNA is created.
10985	5	1	1	The mRNA trvales through the cytoplasm, then enters the ribosome, then the ribosome decodes the amino acids, and then the mRNA leaves the ribosome and the ribosome makes more of that codon.
10995	5	1	1	Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus it has to make another kind of RNA to transfer the information to the other parts of the cells and the body. The codons of the messenger RNA are matched up with their codons for a transfer RNA. The transfer RNA is made and can then continue to do its job while more transfer RNAs are being copied. Then the Rnas can go to the ribosomes and give them the message to make more proteins.
11001	5	1	1	There four major steps of protien synthesis. The first is the mRNA going to the rRNA. Then the rRNA takes the information from the mRNA to the tRNA. Next the tRNA will take the information it has and translate it. Lastly, the tRNA will take the information and make a protein.
11003	5	1	1	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes.2. Once in the ribosomes, the mRNA gets turned into tRNA.3. The tRNA is gathered by the ribosomes to see what the amino acid sequence is.4. The right things are given to the cell to make proteins.
12535	5	1	1	the mRNA must first leave the nucleusthen it must travel to the rough endoplasmic reticulum(which contains protien)then the mRNA latches on to the endoplasmic reticulum and drops the m part of the mRNAthen the RNA is transfered into protien
12539	5	1	1	1.The mRNA leaves the DNA to go the ribosome to deliever the strand because DNA is not small enough to fit. 2.mRNA is the messanger.3.mRNA gives the strand to tRNA to transport.4.The strand is deleivered
12540	5	1	1	The mRNA travels out of the nucleus with genetic information needed to sythesize protien. Next tRNA bonds to the mRNA strand with the anticodons that match up to the mRNA. When the tRNA attaches it creates the amino acids that form a protein strand.
12543	5	1	1	The mRNA goes into the ribosome. Then protiens start to form. tRNA brings in the protiens. Finally, the protiens all join together and form a amino acid chain.
12546	5	1	1	The mRNA is read by RNA polymerase, tRNA anticodons match up with the codons on the mRNA strand, There is a bond between the mRNA and the tRNA, and the tRNA break off to form a sequence of amino acids.
10967	5	1	1	The mRNA travels to the ribosomes. At the ribosomes the mRNA is copied so that is can be used to create proteins.The copies mRNA is then used as instructions to create proteins.The proteins are made, using the instructions given.
10971	5	2	2	First thing the mRNA does is go to the ribosome.  Next, the tRNA comes and decodes the first three nucleotides.  Then, the tRNA brings over the amino acid that matches the codon.  Last, the tRNA shifts over and the amino acids form peptide bonds with one another.
10996	5	2	2	1. The mRNA attaches to a ribosome, to begin protein synthesis.2. The correct amino acid attaches to the first part of the MRNA in the P-site, while in the A-site another amino acid waits.3. The ribosome keeps moving intil a stop codon is reached and stops.
11046	5	2	2	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it takes the information needed to make a protein to the ribosome. After that the ribosme reads the mRNA code. Then the complimentary tRNA, with its specific amino acid comes in and attatches itself with the mRNA strand. Peptide bonds are put inbetween the amino acids and it folds up in a certain way to make a protein.
11083	5	2	2	1) The mRNA attaches to a ribosome because protein synthiesis takes place in the ribosome.2) Corresponding tRNA attaches to the mRNA where the nitrogenous bases match up.3) These nitrogenous bases code for an amino acid.4) A protein is formed by a strain of amino acids joined by petide bonds.
11103	5	2	2	1) mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the free ribosomes.2) tRNA carrying the anticodon bonds to the mRNA codon in the ribosome.3) new amino acids are formed by the bonding of the codon and the anticodon. 4) the amino acids bind together into macromolecules called proteins.
11148	5	2	2	1. The mRNA goes to the ribosome.2. The ribosome attaches to the mRNA.3. The tRNA comes and attaches to the mRNA, to begin protein synthesis.4. Protein synthesis continues until a stop codon signals to stop.
11157	5	2	2	1. mRNA travels to the ribosomes2. tRNA creates codons from anticodons3. rRNA inteprates the codons and the ribosome makes amino acids4. Amino acids link together and form a protein
11208	5	2	2	1. The first step is when the mRNA releases from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.2. Next the cytoplasm that has the mRNA in it will attach to a ribosome.3. That ribosome will soon make a peptide bond between the first and second amino acid.4. This will continue until it reaches a stop codon.
11313	5	2	2	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads directly to the ribosome where the ribosome matches the codons to their complementry base pairs. The amino acids on the ends of the tRNA are linked to gether by polypeptide chains and soon a stop codon cuts off the amino acids making a protien.
11368	5	2	2	The first big step in protein synthesis is the mRNA leaving the nuclues through nuclear pores. The second big step is finding a ribsome to decode the mRNA. Next, tRNA moves in and adds the anti-codon to start making a protein. The anti-codons are joined by amino acids. To finish the process, a tRNA leaves and the ribosome moves down the mRNA to the next codon. A new tRNA brings a new anti-codon.
10981	5	3	3	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome. Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome. The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon. Also, the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction. This process is repeated until a stop code is reached.
10992	5	3	3	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded. The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome. The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for. A strand of mRNA can be translated several times.
11304	5	3	3	1.  The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2.  tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it.  It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.  3.  The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4.  The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins.
11320	5	3	3	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through the cytoplasm and hooks onto a ribosome. At the ribosome, the tRNA comes and matchs the codons with anti-codons. When the anti-codons have been set on the codons the tRNA then brings over the amino acids that match the codons or anti-codons. They are then held together by a peptide bond.
11377	5	3	2	After the mRNA leave the nucleus, there are four other major steps involved in protein synthesis. First, a tRNA attaches to the strand of mRNA. The first codon of nucleotide bases on the mRNA match the codon on the tRNA. The tRNA codes for an amino acid. Next, another tRNA connects to the next codon, bringing in another amino acid. The first tRNA floats away, leaving the amino acid behind. The amino acids bond. This continues, creating a strand of amino acids, until a stop codon is reached. Then the chain of amino acids is released.
11573	5	3	3	1) tRNA reads the strand of mRNA using anticodons.2) tRNA retrieves amino acids.3) The process continues until a stop codon is reached.4) The newly formed polypeptide is released.
11635	5	3	3	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome and gets attached to it. Next, tRNA comes along and attaches it's anti-codons to the mRNA's codons. Then, an amino acid is created and the tRNA strand leaves and another one is attached to the next three codons. Thus, creation another amino acid and the amino acids are held together in a chain by peptide bonds. The chain that is created is a protein.
11682	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mRNA codes for.  In the ribosome the mRNA is read in the sequence of codons and calls the tRNA to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon.  The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain.  When the protien chain is complete it goes out into the cytoplasm and goes where ever it is needed in the cell or outside of the cell.
11721	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it enters into the cytoplasm, where it docks at a ribosome made of rRNA. Next, tRNA reads the codons and using its anticodons goes out into the cytoplasm to pick up the amino acid that corresponds. It then travels back to the mRNA and connects its amino acid with the one previously set before it. Once the tRNA reaches the stop codon, the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed.
11723	5	3	3	The mRNA finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on.  Once the mRNA finds the ribosome the AUG codon starts the protein synthesis.  Next, tRNA bring the correct anti-codons to the mRNA for the construction of the protein.  Once the tRNA have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons.  The anti-codons are then paired up the the codons on the mRNA strand, and peptide bonds form between each of the anticodons.  When the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made.
